# A brief description of how you approached this discovery.

My approach was to start with trying all possibilities of the switches bing A and B. I later played around with the slider trying out all the numbers between 1-100 and noting down the differences between the different uses of switches as well. My observations were that there was a set of consecutive numbers that had the same image, name, and title displayed for one switch, two switches, or no switches. As I observed changes, I described them in the below. 

# What does the setting of the slider do? What do the switches do? 

The slider changes the image, and the title while the switches change the name. For example, on the increments of 1-19 with switch A on, The switch controls the initial part being 'Ser Alyn Snow', while the slider controls the title being 'The Cursed' and the image displayed 'a wolf.' 

## What names are generated from each switch setting? written as (name, title, image)

### Using just A:

0: Ser Alyn Snow, The Cruel, a sword

1-19: Ser Alyn Snow, The Cursed, a wolf

20-36: Ser Alyn Snow, The Bloody, a deer

37-99: Ser Alyn Snow, The Absurd, a lion

100: Ser Alyn Snow, The Blessed, a dragon

### Using just B:

0: Maester Harrod, The Cruel, a sword

1-19: Maester Harrod, The Cursed, a wolf

20-36: Maester Harrod, The Bloody, a deer

100: Maester Harrod, The Blessed, a dragon

### Using neither A or B:
