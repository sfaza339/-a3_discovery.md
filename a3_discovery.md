## A brief description of how you approached this discovery.

My approach was to start with trying all possibilities of the switches being A, B, A and B, and neither A or B. I then disscovered that there are 3 different title name types that can be given. I later played around with the slider trying out all the numbers between 1-100. My observations were that there was a set of consecutive numbers that have the same image, name, and title displayed. As I observed changes, I described it in the third part of this assignment.
