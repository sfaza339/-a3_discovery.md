## 2. A brief description of how you approached this discovery.

My approach was to start with trying all possibilities of the switches being A, B, A and B, and neither A or B. I then disscovered that there are 3 different title name types that can be given. I later played around with the slider trying out all the numbers between 1-100. My observations were that there was a set of consecutive numbers that have the same image, name, and title displayed. As I observed changes, I described it in the third part of this assignment. 

## 3. A detailed description of the website behaviour. what names are generated from each switch setting? What does the setting of the slider do?

### Using just A

### Using just B

### Using A and B

### Using neither A or B
